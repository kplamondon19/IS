@article{Iacovides2015,
	abstract = {Previous research has shown that player involvement can be influenced by a range of factors, from the controllers used to the perceived level of challenge provided by the game. However, little attention has been paid to the influence of the game interface. Game interfaces consist of both diegetic (that can be viewed by the player-character, e.g. the game world) and non-diegetic components (that are only viewed by the player, e.g. the heads-up display). In this paper we examine two versions of a first-person shooter game to investigate how immersion is influenced through interacting with a diegetic and non-diegetic interface. Our findings suggest that the removal of non-diegetic elements, such as the heads-up display, is able to influence immersion in expert players through increasing their cognitive involvement and sense of control. We argue that these results illustrate the importance of considering the role of expertise in relation to how particular design choices will influence the player experience.},

These areas include medicine, entertainment, architecture, education and manufacturing, with VR tools being used for testing and prototyping products at design stages, as well as for creating applications in finished products. This book looks at how to generate advanced virtual reality worlds. It covers principles, techniques, devices and mathematical foundations, beginning with basic definitions, and then moving on to the latest results from current research and exploring the social implications of these. The book looks at topics not normally covered in the literature. Very practical in its approach, the book is fully illustrated in colour and contains numerous examples, exercises and case studies. Careful reading of this textbook will allow students and practitioners alike to gain a practical understanding of virtual reality concepts, devices and possible applications.},

@article{Nguyen2012,
	abstract = {Computer and Video Games are one of the most popular and the most important products of the software industry. One of the greatest contributors to this success is the rapid improvement of technologies. However, the Game Development processes still have to face some difficulties. In fact, the lack of guidelines and theoretical foundations are the major causes for most of Game Designers need to bring their own experiences and intuitions into the Game Design. Therefore, it is essential to increase the involvement of the Human Computer Interaction (or HCI) knowledge in the processes of designing games. The Thesis‘s intention was presenting the overview of HCI and Game Design in many aspects; the relationship between HCI and computer game, and the discussion of how HCI‘s processes and methodologies have been used in Game Design. In addition, the Thesis work followed the qualitative approach. Information was summarized and collected from a variety of published sources. The Thesis result concluded with there is a weak link between the HCI and the Game Design. For the reason, the idea of bringing HCI in the Game Design process is a new concept. Moreover, the Thesis also pointed out the important roles of the Heuristics in the Game Usability inspection, since Game Heuristics have the potential to improve the Game Design process. Keywords:},

@article{AbuBakar2017,
	abstract = {Narrative games may offer reasoning on players' behaviour or make-believe on players' personation as a pursuit to achieve specific goals. One of the goals is probably the intention to instil learning, which subconsciously provides information on the content of the game. However, there is a lack of studies on the contribution of game aesthetics towards player's perceived learning. By means of expert review, this article reports on a conceptual model of game aesthetics towards perceived learning and the degree of importance of each attribute in perceived learning. Findings reveal that all experts agreed on the contribution of game aesthetics towards perceived learning. In addition, the expert recommends three other factors that may contribute to learning: player's motivation, learning content, and gameplay. Future work will continue to design and develop the game prototype and to investigate the relationship between game aesthetics and perceived learning.},
